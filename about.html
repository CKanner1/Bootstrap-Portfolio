                My name is Carl Kanner and I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio.  I currently live in Little Italy with my wife Kim and our 3-month-old son August.
            <p>
                We are a two cat household.  I inherited my wife's and mother-in-law's pet cat Pery and Monkey.  They hate each other, and our home is filled with the sounds of hissing cats and the occasional crying baby...I assure you it's not as bad as it sounds unless your trying study and master floating in CSS</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work in a family business with my father and brother-in-law.  Before working in the family business, I graduated from Babson College in Boston.  Babson College is a small, 1,400 U-Grad college offering degrees only in business.  They are best known for their studies in entrepreneurship and have been ranked #1 in that subject for 21 consecutive years by US News and World Report.  
            </p>
            <p>
                After college, I started and ran several of my own companies.
                The most successful of which is called Alpha Architect.  Alpha Architect is a registered investment advisor that markets and sells our proprietary quantitative investment strategies. 
                Alpha Architect goes to market through separately managed accounts, a traditional hedge fund product and through our five publically traded exchange-traded funds.</p>

                Our company Pubco, and through its subsidiaries manufactures and markets pressure sensitive labels, mobile label printers, industrial demolition equipment and typewriters. At my current job, I am responsible for new acquisition, sourcing equipment and helping to oversee our manufacturing operation.
